# pyChemometrics

This small library provides wrapper objects of scitkit-learn Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares 
(PLS) algorithms tailored for chemometric. Implementations of PCA, PLS regression and PLS based 
discriminant analysis methods as well as of the common validation metrics seen in the chemometric and metabonomic literature 
are provided (Scaling methods, Q2Y measure, permutation tests, cross-validation schemes, for example).
