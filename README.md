# pyChemometrics

This small library contains wrappers of scitkit-learn PCA and PLS algorithms for analysis of chemometric datasets.
PCA, PLS regression and PLS based discriminant analysis methods are available, and some of the common validation metrics
seen in the chemometrics field are provided (Scaling methods, Q2Y measure, permutation tests, cross-validation schemes,
 for example)
