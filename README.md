# pyChemometrics

This library provides wrapper objects of scitkit-learn Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares 
(PLS) algorithms tailored for analysis of chemometric datasets. Implementations of PCA, PLS regression and PLS based 
discriminant analysis methods as well as of the common validation metrics seen in the chemometric and metabonomic literature 
are provided (Pareto and unit variance scaling options, Q2Y measure for cross-validation, permutation tests, K-fold cross-validation schemes, VIP variable importance metric, for example).
